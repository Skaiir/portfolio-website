## My portfolio

### Instead of writing code and forgetting about it forever, I've started this little portfolio website to display projects.
<br>
The current projects displayed on the site at the moment are:

- A cloth simulation (visuals using canvas)
- A generative art project (canvas again)
- Information on a ray tracing engine I built a while back, because it's cool and gathering dust
- A full React calculator, just to prove I can use it at least a little
- And some other stuff
